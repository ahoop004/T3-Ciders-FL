# Teaching Federated Learning: From Basics to Research

## Overview

This workshop on Federated Learning (FL) is designed to be **entry-point flexible**. Learners begin with a quick survey to assess their background and confidence. Based on the result, they start at the most appropriate sub‑module and then proceed sequentially from there. This structure supports diverse learners and emphasizes pedagogical flexibility.

## Learning Framework

Our design draws on key educational frameworks:

- **Differentiated Instruction**: Tailors entry points, content, and assessment to learner readiness, interests, and learning profiles to maximize engagement and learning effectiveness 
- **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)**: Promotes flexible learning pathways using **multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression**—making content accessible and meaningful to all learners

## Overall Learning Objectives

By the end of the workshop, learners will be able to:

- **Remember** core concepts of Federated Learning.
- **Understand** how FL differs from centralized and distributed paradigms.
- **Apply** FL algorithms in notebook environments for collaborative model training.
- **Analyze** the impact of IID vs. non‑IID data distributions.
- **Evaluate** FL model robustness under adversarial poisoning.
- **Create** scalable experiments using HPC infrastructure and SLURM.

## Flexible Entry and Sequential Progression

Learner progression:

1. **Survey & Pre‑Assessment** (planned): Helps determine learner’s current understanding and confidence.
2. **Module Selection**: The survey suggests the most suitable starting module (1–5) based on readiness.
3. **Sequential Pathway**: From that entry point, learners continue in numerical order (e.g. start at Module 3, then 4, then 5).
